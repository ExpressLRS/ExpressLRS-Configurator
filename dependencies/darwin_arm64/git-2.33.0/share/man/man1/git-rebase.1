git-rebase \- Reapply commits on top of another base tip
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit rebase\fR [\-i | \-\-interactive] [<options>] [\-\-exec <cmd>]
        [\-\-onto <newbase> | \-\-keep\-base] [<upstream> [<branch>]]
\fIgit rebase\fR [\-i | \-\-interactive] [<options>] [\-\-exec <cmd>] [\-\-onto <newbase>]
        \-\-root [<branch>]
\fIgit rebase\fR (\-\-continue | \-\-skip | \-\-abort | \-\-quit | \-\-edit\-todo | \-\-show\-current\-patch)
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
If <branch> is specified, \fIgit rebase\fR will perform an automatic \fBgit switch <branch>\fR before doing anything else\&. Otherwise it remains on the current branch\&.
.sp
If <upstream> is not specified, the upstream configured in branch\&.<name>\&.remote and branch\&.<name>\&.merge options will be used (see \fBgit-config\fR(1) for details) and the \fB\-\-fork\-point\fR option is assumed\&. If you are currently not on any branch or if the current branch does not have a configured upstream, the rebase will abort\&.
.sp
All changes made by commits in the current branch but that are not in <upstream> are saved to a temporary area\&. This is the same set of commits that would be shown by \fBgit log <upstream>\&.\&.HEAD\fR; or by \fBgit log \*(Aqfork_point\*(Aq\&.\&.HEAD\fR, if \fB\-\-fork\-point\fR is active (see the description on \fB\-\-fork\-point\fR below); or by \fBgit log HEAD\fR, if the \fB\-\-root\fR option is specified\&.
.sp
The current branch is reset to <upstream>, or <newbase> if the \-\-onto option was supplied\&. This has the exact same effect as \fBgit reset \-\-hard <upstream>\fR (or <newbase>)\&. ORIG_HEAD is set to point at the tip of the branch before the reset\&.
.sp
The commits that were previously saved into the temporary area are then reapplied to the current branch, one by one, in order\&. Note that any commits in HEAD which introduce the same textual changes as a commit in HEAD\&.\&.<upstream> are omitted (i\&.e\&., a patch already accepted upstream with a different commit message or timestamp will be skipped)\&.
.sp
It is possible that a merge failure will prevent this process from being completely automatic\&. You will have to resolve any such merge failure and run \fBgit rebase \-\-continue\fR\&. Another option is to bypass the commit that caused the merge failure with \fBgit rebase \-\-skip\fR\&. To check out the original <branch> and remove the \&.git/rebase\-apply working files, use the command \fBgit rebase \-\-abort\fR instead\&.
.sp
Assume the following history exists and the current branch is "topic":
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
          A\-\-\-B\-\-\-C topic
         /
    D\-\-\-E\-\-\-F\-\-\-G master
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
From this point, the result of either of the following commands:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git rebase master
git rebase master topic
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
would be:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
                  A\*(Aq\-\-B\*(Aq\-\-C\*(Aq topic
                 /
    D\-\-\-E\-\-\-F\-\-\-G master
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fR The latter form is just a short\-hand of \fBgit checkout topic\fR followed by \fBgit rebase master\fR\&. When rebase exits \fBtopic\fR will remain the checked\-out branch\&.
.sp
If the upstream branch already contains a change you have made (e\&.g\&., because you mailed a patch which was applied upstream), then that commit will be skipped\&. For example, running \fBgit rebase master\fR on the following history (in which \fBA\*(Aq\fR and \fBA\fR introduce the same set of changes, but have different committer information):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
          A\-\-\-B\-\-\-C topic
         /
    D\-\-\-E\-\-\-A\*(Aq\-\-\-F master
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
will result in:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
                   B\*(Aq\-\-\-C\*(Aq topic
                  /
    D\-\-\-E\-\-\-A\*(Aq\-\-\-F master
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Here is how you would transplant a topic branch based on one branch to another, to pretend that you forked the topic branch from the latter branch, using \fBrebase \-\-onto\fR\&.
.sp
First let\(cqs assume your \fItopic\fR is based on branch \fInext\fR\&. For example, a feature developed in \fItopic\fR depends on some functionality which is found in \fInext\fR\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o  master
         \e
          o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o  next
                           \e
                            o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o  topic
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
We want to make \fItopic\fR forked from branch \fImaster\fR; for example, because the functionality on which \fItopic\fR depends was merged into the more stable \fImaster\fR branch\&. We want our tree to look like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o  master
        |            \e
        |             o\*(Aq\-\-o\*(Aq\-\-o\*(Aq  topic
         \e
          o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o  next
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
We can get this using the following command:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git rebase \-\-onto master next topic
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Another example of \-\-onto option is to rebase part of a branch\&. If we have the following situation:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
                            H\-\-\-I\-\-\-J topicB
                           /
                  E\-\-\-F\-\-\-G  topicA
                 /
    A\-\-\-B\-\-\-C\-\-\-D  master
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
then the command
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git rebase \-\-onto master topicA topicB
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
would result in:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
                 H\*(Aq\-\-I\*(Aq\-\-J\*(Aq  topicB
                /
                | E\-\-\-F\-\-\-G  topicA
                |/
    A\-\-\-B\-\-\-C\-\-\-D  master
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
This is useful when topicB does not depend on topicA\&.
.sp
A range of commits could also be removed with rebase\&. If we have the following situation:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    E\-\-\-F\-\-\-G\-\-\-H\-\-\-I\-\-\-J  topicA
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
then the command
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git rebase \-\-onto topicA~5 topicA~3 topicA
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
would result in the removal of commits F and G:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    E\-\-\-H\*(Aq\-\-\-I\*(Aq\-\-\-J\*(Aq  topicA
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
This is useful if F and G were flawed in some way, or should not be part of topicA\&. Note that the argument to \-\-onto and the <upstream> parameter can be any valid commit\-ish\&.
.sp
In case of conflict, \fIgit rebase\fR will stop at the first problematic commit and leave conflict markers in the tree\&. You can use \fIgit diff\fR to locate the markers (<<<<<<) and make edits to resolve the conflict\&. For each file you edit, you need to tell Git that the conflict has been resolved, typically this would be done with
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git add <filename>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
After resolving the conflict manually and updating the index with the desired resolution, you can continue the rebasing process with
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git rebase \-\-continue
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Alternatively, you can undo the \fIgit rebase\fR with
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git rebase \-\-abort
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-\-onto <newbase>
.RS 4
Starting point at which to create the new commits\&. If the \-\-onto option is not specified, the starting point is <upstream>\&. May be any valid commit, and not just an existing branch name\&.
.sp
As a special case, you may use "A\&.\&.\&.B" as a shortcut for the merge base of A and B if there is exactly one merge base\&. You can leave out at most one of A and B, in which case it defaults to HEAD\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-keep\-base
.RS 4
Set the starting point at which to create the new commits to the merge base of <upstream> <branch>\&. Running
\fIgit rebase \-\-keep\-base <upstream> <branch>\fR
is equivalent to running
\fIgit rebase \-\-onto <upstream>\&... <upstream>\fR\&.
.sp
This option is useful in the case where one is developing a feature on top of an upstream branch\&. While the feature is being worked on, the upstream branch may advance and it may not be the best idea to keep rebasing on top of the upstream but to keep the base commit as\-is\&.
.sp
Although both this option and \-\-fork\-point find the merge base between <upstream> and <branch>, this option uses the merge base as the
\fIstarting point\fR
on which new commits will be created, whereas \-\-fork\-point uses the merge base to determine the
\fIset of commits\fR
which will be rebased\&.
.sp
See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below\&.
.RE
.PP
<upstream>
.RS 4
Upstream branch to compare against\&. May be any valid commit, not just an existing branch name\&. Defaults to the configured upstream for the current branch\&.
.RE
.PP
<branch>
.RS 4
Working branch; defaults to HEAD\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-continue
.RS 4
Restart the rebasing process after having resolved a merge conflict\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-abort
.RS 4
Abort the rebase operation and reset HEAD to the original branch\&. If <branch> was provided when the rebase operation was started, then HEAD will be reset to <branch>\&. Otherwise HEAD will be reset to where it was when the rebase operation was started\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-quit
.RS 4
Abort the rebase operation but HEAD is not reset back to the original branch\&. The index and working tree are also left unchanged as a result\&. If a temporary stash entry was created using \-\-autostash, it will be saved to the stash list\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-apply
.RS 4
Use applying strategies to rebase (calling
\fBgit\-am\fR
internally)\&. This option may become a no\-op in the future once the merge backend handles everything the apply one does\&.
.sp
See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-empty={drop,keep,ask}
.RS 4
How to handle commits that are not empty to start and are not clean cherry\-picks of any upstream commit, but which become empty after rebasing (because they contain a subset of already upstream changes)\&. With drop (the default), commits that become empty are dropped\&. With keep, such commits are kept\&. With ask (implied by \-\-interactive), the rebase will halt when an empty commit is applied allowing you to choose whether to drop it, edit files more, or just commit the empty changes\&. Other options, like \-\-exec, will use the default of drop unless \-i/\-\-interactive is explicitly specified\&.
.sp
Note that commits which start empty are kept (unless \-\-no\-keep\-empty is specified), and commits which are clean cherry\-picks (as determined by
\fBgit log \-\-cherry\-mark \&.\&.\&.\fR) are detected and dropped as a preliminary step (unless \-\-reapply\-cherry\-picks is passed)\&.
.sp
See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-keep\-empty, \-\-keep\-empty
.RS 4
Do not keep commits that start empty before the rebase (i\&.e\&. that do not change anything from its parent) in the result\&. The default is to keep commits which start empty, since creating such commits requires passing the \-\-allow\-empty override flag to
\fBgit commit\fR, signifying that a user is very intentionally creating such a commit and thus wants to keep it\&.
.sp
Usage of this flag will probably be rare, since you can get rid of commits that start empty by just firing up an interactive rebase and removing the lines corresponding to the commits you don\(cqt want\&. This flag exists as a convenient shortcut, such as for cases where external tools generate many empty commits and you want them all removed\&.
.sp
For commits which do not start empty but become empty after rebasing, see the \-\-empty flag\&.
.sp
See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-reapply\-cherry\-picks, \-\-no\-reapply\-cherry\-picks
.RS 4
Reapply all clean cherry\-picks of any upstream commit instead of preemptively dropping them\&. (If these commits then become empty after rebasing, because they contain a subset of already upstream changes, the behavior towards them is controlled by the
\fB\-\-empty\fR
flag\&.)
.sp
By default (or if
\fB\-\-no\-reapply\-cherry\-picks\fR
is given), these commits will be automatically dropped\&. Because this necessitates reading all upstream commits, this can be expensive in repos with a large number of upstream commits that need to be read\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-reapply\-cherry\-picks\fR
allows rebase to forgo reading all upstream commits, potentially improving performance\&.
.sp
See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-allow\-empty\-message
.RS 4
No\-op\&. Rebasing commits with an empty message used to fail and this option would override that behavior, allowing commits with empty messages to be rebased\&. Now commits with an empty message do not cause rebasing to halt\&.
.sp
See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-skip
.RS 4
Restart the rebasing process by skipping the current patch\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-edit\-todo
.RS 4
Edit the todo list during an interactive rebase\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-show\-current\-patch
.RS 4
Show the current patch in an interactive rebase or when rebase is stopped because of conflicts\&. This is the equivalent of
\fBgit show REBASE_HEAD\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-m, \-\-merge
.RS 4
Use merging strategies to rebase\&. When the recursive (default) merge strategy is used, this allows rebase to be aware of renames on the upstream side\&. This is the default\&.
.sp
Note that a rebase merge works by replaying each commit from the working branch on top of the <upstream> branch\&. Because of this, when a merge conflict happens, the side reported as
\fIours\fR
is the so\-far rebased series, starting with <upstream>, and
\fItheirs\fR
is the working branch\&. In other words, the sides are swapped\&.
.sp
See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s <strategy>, \-\-strategy=<strategy>
.RS 4
Use the given merge strategy\&. If there is no
\fB\-s\fR
option
\fIgit merge\-recursive\fR
is used instead\&. This implies \-\-merge\&.
.sp
Because
\fIgit rebase\fR
replays each commit from the working branch on top of the <upstream> branch using the given strategy, using the
\fIours\fR
strategy simply empties all patches from the <branch>, which makes little sense\&.
.sp
See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below\&.
.RE
.PP
\-X <strategy\-option>, \-\-strategy\-option=<strategy\-option>
.RS 4
Pass the <strategy\-option> through to the merge strategy\&. This implies
\fB\-\-merge\fR
and, if no strategy has been specified,
\fB\-s recursive\fR\&. Note the reversal of
\fIours\fR
and
\fItheirs\fR
as noted above for the
\fB\-m\fR
option\&.

.RE
.PP
\-S[<keyid>], \-\-gpg\-sign[=<keyid>], \-\-no\-gpg\-sign
.RS 4
GPG\-sign commits\&. The
\fBkeyid\fR
argument is optional and defaults to the committer identity; if specified, it must be stuck to the option without a space\&.
\fB\-\-no\-gpg\-sign\fR
is useful to countermand both
\fBcommit\&.gpgSign\fR
configuration variable, and earlier
\fB\-\-gpg\-sign\fR\&.

.RE
.PP
\-C<n>
.RS 4
Ensure at least <n> lines of surrounding context match before and after each change\&. When fewer lines of surrounding context exist they all must match\&. By default no context is ever ignored\&. Implies \-\-apply\&.

See also INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS below\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-ff, \-\-force\-rebase, \-f
.RS 4
Individually replay all rebased commits instead of fast\-forwarding over the unchanged ones\&. This ensures that the entire history of the rebased branch is composed of new commits\&.
.sp
You may find this helpful after reverting a topic branch merge, as this option recreates the topic branch with fresh commits so it can be remerged successfully without needing to "revert the reversion" (see the
\m[blue]\fBrevert\-a\-faulty\-merge How\-To\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2

.RE
.PP
\-\-fork\-point, \-\-no\-fork\-point
.RS 4
Use reflog to find a better common ancestor between <upstream> and <branch> when calculating which commits have been introduced by <branch>\&.
.sp
When \-\-fork\-point is active,
\fIfork_point\fR
will be used instead of <upstream> to calculate the set of commits to rebase, where
\fIfork_point\fR
is the result of
\fBgit merge\-base \-\-fork\-point <upstream> <branch>\fR
command (see
\fBgit-merge-base\fR(1))\&. If
\fIfork_point\fR
ends up being empty, the <upstream> will be used as a fallback\&.
.sp
If <upstream> is given on the command line, then the default is
\fB\-\-no\-fork\-point\fR, otherwise the default is
\fB\-\-fork\-point\fR\&.
.sp
If your branch was based on <upstream> but <upstream> was rewound and your branch contains commits which were dropped, this option can be used with
\fB\-\-keep\-base\fR
in order to drop those commits from your branch\&.

\-\-ignore\-whitespace
.RS 4
Ignore whitespace differences when trying to reconcile differences\&. Currently, each backend implements an approximation of this behavior:
.sp
apply backend: When applying a patch, ignore changes in whitespace in context lines\&. Unfortunately, this means that if the "old" lines being replaced by the patch differ only in whitespace from the existing file, you will get a merge conflict instead of a successful patch application\&.
.sp
merge backend: Treat lines with only whitespace changes as unchanged when merging\&. Unfortunately, this means that any patch hunks that were intended to modify whitespace and nothing else will be dropped, even if the other side had no changes that conflicted\&.

\-r, \-\-rebase\-merges[=(rebase\-cousins|no\-rebase\-cousins)]
.RS 4
By default, a rebase will simply drop merge commits from the todo list, and put the rebased commits into a single, linear branch\&. With
\fB\-\-rebase\-merges\fR, the rebase will instead try to preserve the branching structure within the commits that are to be rebased, by recreating the merge commits\&. Any resolved merge conflicts or manual amendments in these merge commits will have to be resolved/re\-applied manually\&.
.sp
By default, or when
\fBno\-rebase\-cousins\fR
was specified, commits which do not have
\fB<upstream>\fR
as direct ancestor will keep their original branch point, i\&.e\&. commits that would be excluded by
\fBgit-log\fR(1)\*(Aqs
\fB\-\-ancestry\-path\fR
option will keep their original ancestry by default\&. If the
\fBrebase\-cousins\fR
mode is turned on, such commits are instead rebased onto
\fB<upstream>\fR
(or
\fB<onto>\fR, if specified)\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-\-rebase\-merges\fR
mode is similar in spirit to the deprecated
\fB\-\-preserve\-merges\fR
but works with interactive rebases, where commits can be reordered, inserted and dropped at will\&.
.sp
It is currently only possible to recreate the merge commits using the
\fBrecursive\fR
merge strategy; Different merge strategies can be used only via explicit
\fBexec git merge \-s <strategy> [\&.\&.\&.]\fR
commands\&.

.SH "BEHAVIORAL DIFFERENCES"
.sp
git rebase has two primary backends: apply and merge\&. (The apply backend used to be known as the \fIam\fR backend, but the name led to confusion as it looks like a verb instead of a noun\&. Also, the merge backend used to be known as the interactive backend, but it is now used for non\-interactive cases as well\&. Both were renamed based on lower\-level functionality that underpinned each\&.) There are some subtle differences in how these two backends behave:
.SS "Empty commits"
.sp
The apply backend unfortunately drops intentionally empty commits, i\&.e\&. commits that started empty, though these are rare in practice\&. It also drops commits that become empty and has no option for controlling this behavior\&.
.sp
The merge backend keeps intentionally empty commits by default (though with \-i they are marked as empty in the todo list editor, or they can be dropped automatically with \-\-no\-keep\-empty)\&.
.sp
Similar to the apply backend, by default the merge backend drops commits that become empty unless \-i/\-\-interactive is specified (in which case it stops and asks the user what to do)\&. The merge backend also has an \-\-empty={drop,keep,ask} option for changing the behavior of handling commits that become empty\&.
.SS "Directory rename detection"
.sp
Due to the lack of accurate tree information (arising from constructing fake ancestors with the limited information available in patches), directory rename detection is disabled in the apply backend\&. Disabled directory rename detection means that if one side of history renames a directory and the other adds new files to the old directory, then the new files will be left behind in the old directory without any warning at the time of rebasing that you may want to move these files into the new directory\&.
.sp
Directory rename detection works with the merge backend to provide you warnings in such cases\&.
.SS "Context"
.sp
The apply backend works by creating a sequence of patches (by calling \fBformat\-patch\fR internally), and then applying the patches in sequence (calling \fBam\fR internally)\&. Patches are composed of multiple hunks, each with line numbers, a context region, and the actual changes\&. The line numbers have to be taken with some fuzz, since the other side will likely have inserted or deleted lines earlier in the file\&. The context region is meant to help find how to adjust the line numbers in order to apply the changes to the right lines\&. However, if multiple areas of the code have the same surrounding lines of context, the wrong one can be picked\&. There are real\-world cases where this has caused commits to be reapplied incorrectly with no conflicts reported\&. Setting diff\&.context to a larger value may prevent such types of problems, but increases the chance of spurious conflicts (since it will require more lines of matching context to apply)\&.
.sp
The merge backend works with a full copy of each relevant file, insulating it from these types of problems\&.
.SS "Labelling of conflicts markers"
.sp
When there are content conflicts, the merge machinery tries to annotate each side\(cqs conflict markers with the commits where the content came from\&. Since the apply backend drops the original information about the rebased commits and their parents (and instead generates new fake commits based off limited information in the generated patches), those commits cannot be identified; instead it has to fall back to a commit summary\&. Also, when merge\&.conflictStyle is set to diff3, the apply backend will use "constructed merge base" to label the content from the merge base, and thus provide no information about the merge base commit whatsoever\&.
.sp
The merge backend works with the full commits on both sides of history and thus has no such limitations\&.
.SS "Hooks"
.sp
The apply backend has not traditionally called the post\-commit hook, while the merge backend has\&. Both have called the post\-checkout hook, though the merge backend has squelched its output\&. Further, both backends only call the post\-checkout hook with the starting point commit of the rebase, not the intermediate commits nor the final commit\&. In each case, the calling of these hooks was by accident of implementation rather than by design (both backends were originally implemented as shell scripts and happened to invoke other commands like \fIgit checkout\fR or \fIgit commit\fR that would call the hooks)\&. Both backends should have the same behavior, though it is not entirely clear which, if any, is correct\&. We will likely make rebase stop calling either of these hooks in the future\&.
.SS "Interruptability"
.sp
The apply backend has safety problems with an ill\-timed interrupt; if the user presses Ctrl\-C at the wrong time to try to abort the rebase, the rebase can enter a state where it cannot be aborted with a subsequent \fBgit rebase \-\-abort\fR\&. The merge backend does not appear to suffer from the same shortcoming\&. (See \m[blue]\fBhttps://lore\&.kernel\&.org/git/20200207132152\&.GC2868@szeder\&.dev/\fR\m[] for details\&.)
.SS "Commit Rewording"
.sp
When a conflict occurs while rebasing, rebase stops and asks the user to resolve\&. Since the user may need to make notable changes while resolving conflicts, after conflicts are resolved and the user has run \fBgit rebase \-\-continue\fR, the rebase should open an editor and ask the user to update the commit message\&. The merge backend does this, while the apply backend blindly applies the original commit message\&.
.SS "Miscellaneous differences"
.sp
There are a few more behavioral differences that most folks would probably consider inconsequential but which are mentioned for completeness:

recursive
.RS 4
This can only resolve two heads using a 3\-way merge algorithm\&. When there is more than one common ancestor that can be used for 3\-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the 3\-way merge\&. This has been reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without causing mismerges by tests done on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2\&.6 kernel development history\&. Additionally this can detect and handle merges involving renames, but currently cannot make use of detected copies\&. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging one branch\&.

subtree

This is a modified recursive strategy\&. When merging trees A and B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to match the tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at the same level\&. This adjustment is also done to the common ancestor tree\&.
.RE
.sp
With the strategies that use 3\-way merge (including the default, \fIrecursive\fR), if a change is made on both branches, but later reverted on one of the branches, that change will be present in the merged result; some people find this behavior confusing\&. It occurs because only the heads and the merge base are considered when performing a merge, not the individual commits\&. The merge algorithm therefore considers the reverted change as no change at all, and substitutes the changed version instead\&.

You should understand the implications of using \fIgit rebase\fR on a repository that you share\&. See also RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE below\&.

An editor will be fired up with all the commits in your current branch (ignoring merge commits), which come after the given commit\&. You can reorder the commits in this list to your heart\(cqs content, and you can remove them\&. The list looks more or less like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
pick deadbee The oneline of this commit
pick fa1afe1 The oneline of the next commit
\&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
The oneline descriptions are purely for your pleasure; \fIgit rebase\fR will not look at them but at the commit names ("deadbee" and "fa1afe1" in this example), so do not delete or edit the names\&.
.sp
By replacing the command "pick" with the command "edit", you can tell \fIgit rebase\fR to stop after applying that commit, so that you can edit the files and/or the commit message, amend the commit, and continue rebasing\&.
.sp
To interrupt the rebase (just like an "edit" command would do, but without cherry\-picking any commit first), use the "break" command\&.
.sp
If you just want to edit the commit message for a commit, replace the command "pick" with the command "reword"\&.
.sp
To drop a commit, replace the command "pick" with "drop", or just delete the matching line\&.
.sp
If you want to fold two or more commits into one, replace the command "pick" for the second and subsequent commits with "squash" or "fixup"\&. If the commits had different authors, the folded commit will be attributed to the author of the first commit\&. The suggested commit message for the folded commit is the concatenation of the first commit\(cqs message with those identified by "squash" commands, omitting the messages of commits identified by "fixup" commands, unless "fixup \-c" is used\&. In that case the suggested commit message is only the message of the "fixup \-c" commit, and an editor is opened allowing you to edit the message\&. The contents (patch) of the "fixup \-c" commit are still incorporated into the folded commit\&. If there is more than one "fixup \-c" commit, the message from the final one is used\&. You can also use "fixup \-C" to get the same behavior as "fixup \-c" except without opening an editor\&.
.sp
\fIgit rebase\fR will stop when "pick" has been replaced with "edit" or when a command fails due to merge errors\&. When you are done editing and/or resolving conflicts you can continue with \fBgit rebase \-\-continue\fR\&.
.sp
For example, if you want to reorder the last 5 commits, such that what was HEAD~4 becomes the new HEAD\&. To achieve that, you would call \fIgit rebase\fR like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git rebase \-i HEAD~5
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
And move the first patch to the end of the list\&.
.sp
You might want to recreate merge commits, e\&.g\&. if you have a history like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
           X
            \e
         A\-\-\-M\-\-\-B
        /
\-\-\-o\-\-\-O\-\-\-P\-\-\-Q
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Suppose you want to rebase the side branch starting at "A" to "Q"\&. Make sure that the current HEAD is "B", and call
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git rebase \-i \-r \-\-onto Q O
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Reordering and editing commits usually creates untested intermediate steps\&. You may want to check that your history editing did not break anything by running a test, or at least recompiling at intermediate points in history by using the "exec" command (shortcut "x")\&. You may do so by creating a todo list like this one:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
pick deadbee Implement feature XXX
fixup f1a5c00 Fix to feature XXX
exec make
pick c0ffeee The oneline of the next commit
edit deadbab The oneline of the commit after
exec cd subdir; make test
\&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
The interactive rebase will stop when a command fails (i\&.e\&. exits with non\-0 status) to give you an opportunity to fix the problem\&. You can continue with \fBgit rebase \-\-continue\fR\&.
.sp
The "exec" command launches the command in a shell (the one specified in \fB$SHELL\fR, or the default shell if \fB$SHELL\fR is not set), so you can use shell features (like "cd", ">", ";" \&...)\&. The command is run from the root of the working tree\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git rebase \-i \-\-exec "make test"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
This command lets you check that intermediate commits are compilable\&. The todo list becomes like that:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
pick 5928aea one
exec make test
pick 04d0fda two
exec make test
pick ba46169 three

exec make test
.fi

.SH "SPLITTING COMMITS"
.sp
In interactive mode, you can mark commits with the action "edit"\&. However, this does not necessarily mean that \fIgit rebase\fR expects the result of this edit to be exactly one commit\&. Indeed, you can undo the commit, or you can add other commits\&. This can be used to split a commit into two:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Start an interactive rebase with
\fBgit rebase \-i <commit>^\fR, where <commit> is the commit you want to split\&. In fact, any commit range will do, as long as it contains that commit\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Mark the commit you want to split with the action "edit"\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
When it comes to editing that commit, execute
\fBgit reset HEAD^\fR\&. The effect is that the HEAD is rewound by one, and the index follows suit\&. However, the working tree stays the same\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Now add the changes to the index that you want to have in the first commit\&. You can use
\fBgit add\fR
(possibly interactively) or
\fIgit gui\fR
(or both) to do that\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c

.el \{\

.IP \(bu 2.3

Commit the now\-current index with whatever commit message is appropriate now\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\

\fBgit rebase \-\-continue\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
If you are not absolutely sure that the intermediate revisions are consistent (they compile, pass the testsuite, etc\&.) you should use \fIgit stash\fR to stash away the not\-yet\-committed changes after each commit, test, and amend the commit if fixes are necessary\&.
.SH "RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE"
.sp
Rebasing (or any other form of rewriting) a branch that others have based work on is a bad idea: anyone downstream of it is forced to manually fix their history\&. This section explains how to do the fix from the downstream\(cqs point of view\&. The real fix, however, would be to avoid rebasing the upstream in the first place\&.
.sp
To illustrate, suppose you are in a situation where someone develops a \fIsubsystem\fR branch, and you are working on a \fItopic\fR that is dependent on this \fIsubsystem\fR\&. You might end up with a history like the following:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o  master

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
If \fIsubsystem\fR is rebased against \fImaster\fR, the following happens:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o  master

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
If you now continue development as usual, and eventually merge \fItopic\fR to \fIsubsystem\fR, the commits from \fIsubsystem\fR will remain duplicated forever:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o\-\-\-o  master

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Such duplicates are generally frowned upon because they clutter up history, making it harder to follow\&. To clean things up, you need to transplant the commits on \fItopic\fR to the new \fIsubsystem\fR tip, i\&.e\&., rebase \fItopic\fR\&. This becomes a ripple effect: anyone downstream from \fItopic\fR is forced to rebase too, and so on!
.sp
There are two kinds of fixes, discussed in the following subsections:
.PP
Easy case: The changes are literally the same\&.
.RS 4
This happens if the
\fIsubsystem\fR
rebase was a simple rebase and had no conflicts\&.
.RE
.PP
Hard case: The changes are not the same\&.
.RS 4
This happens if the
\fIsubsystem\fR
rebase had conflicts, or used
\fB\-\-interactive\fR
to omit, edit, squash, or fixup commits; or if the upstream used one of
\fBcommit \-\-amend\fR,
\fBreset\fR, or a full history rewriting command like
\m[blue]\fB\fBfilter\-repo\fR\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2\&.
.RE
.SS "The easy case"
.sp
Only works if the changes (patch IDs based on the diff contents) on \fIsubsystem\fR are literally the same before and after the rebase \fIsubsystem\fR did\&.

In that case, the fix is easy because \fIgit rebase\fR knows to skip changes that are already present in the new upstream (unless \fB\-\-reapply\-cherry\-picks\fR is given)\&. So if you say (assuming you\(cqre on \fItopic\fR)

The idea is to manually tell \fIgit rebase\fR "where the old \fIsubsystem\fR ended and your \fItopic\fR began", that is, what the old merge base between them was\&. You will have to find a way to name the last commit of the old \fIsubsystem\fR, for example:
.sp

reflog: after
\fIgit fetch\fR, the old tip of

Relative to the tip of

\fIsubsystem\fR
must be
\fBtopic~3\fR\&.
.RE

You can then transplant the old \fBsubsystem\&.\&.topic\fR to the new tip by saying (for the reflog case, and assuming you are on \fItopic\fR already):

The ripple effect of a "hard case" recovery is especially bad: \fIeveryone\fR downstream from \fItopic\fR will now have to perform a "hard case" recovery too!
.SH "REBASING MERGES"
.sp
The interactive rebase command was originally designed to handle individual patch series\&. As such, it makes sense to exclude merge commits from the todo list, as the developer may have merged the then\-current \fBmaster\fR while working on the branch, only to rebase all the commits onto \fBmaster\fR eventually (skipping the merge commits)\&.
.sp
However, there are legitimate reasons why a developer may want to recreate merge commits: to keep the branch structure (or "commit topology") when working on multiple, inter\-related branches\&.
.sp
In the following example, the developer works on a topic branch that refactors the way buttons are defined, and on another topic branch that uses that refactoring to implement a "Report a bug" button\&. The output of \fBgit log \-\-graph \-\-format=%s \-5\fR may look like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
*   Merge branch \*(Aqreport\-a\-bug\*(Aq
|\e
| * Add the feedback button
* | Merge branch \*(Aqrefactor\-button\*(Aq
|\e \e
| |/
| * Use the Button class for all buttons
| * Extract a generic Button class from the DownloadButton one
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
The developer might want to rebase those commits to a newer \fBmaster\fR while keeping the branch topology, for example when the first topic branch is expected to be integrated into \fBmaster\fR much earlier than the second one, say, to resolve merge conflicts with changes to the DownloadButton class that made it into \fBmaster\fR\&.
.sp
This rebase can be performed using the \fB\-\-rebase\-merges\fR option\&. It will generate a todo list looking like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
label onto

# Branch: refactor\-button
reset onto
pick 123456 Extract a generic Button class from the DownloadButton one
pick 654321 Use the Button class for all buttons
label refactor\-button

# Branch: report\-a\-bug
reset refactor\-button # Use the Button class for all buttons
pick abcdef Add the feedback button
label report\-a\-bug

reset onto
merge \-C a1b2c3 refactor\-button # Merge \*(Aqrefactor\-button\*(Aq
merge \-C 6f5e4d report\-a\-bug # Merge \*(Aqreport\-a\-bug\*(Aq
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
In contrast to a regular interactive rebase, there are \fBlabel\fR, \fBreset\fR and \fBmerge\fR commands in addition to \fBpick\fR ones\&.
.sp
The \fBlabel\fR command associates a label with the current HEAD when that command is executed\&. These labels are created as worktree\-local refs (\fBrefs/rewritten/<label>\fR) that will be deleted when the rebase finishes\&. That way, rebase operations in multiple worktrees linked to the same repository do not interfere with one another\&. If the \fBlabel\fR command fails, it is rescheduled immediately, with a helpful message how to proceed\&.
.sp
The \fBreset\fR command resets the HEAD, index and worktree to the specified revision\&. It is similar to an \fBexec git reset \-\-hard <label>\fR, but refuses to overwrite untracked files\&. If the \fBreset\fR command fails, it is rescheduled immediately, with a helpful message how to edit the todo list (this typically happens when a \fBreset\fR command was inserted into the todo list manually and contains a typo)\&.
.sp
The \fBmerge\fR command will merge the specified revision(s) into whatever is HEAD at that time\&. With \fB\-C <original\-commit>\fR, the commit message of the specified merge commit will be used\&. When the \fB\-C\fR is changed to a lower\-case \fB\-c\fR, the message will be opened in an editor after a successful merge so that the user can edit the message\&.
.sp
If a \fBmerge\fR command fails for any reason other than merge conflicts (i\&.e\&. when the merge operation did not even start), it is rescheduled immediately\&.
.sp
At this time, the \fBmerge\fR command will \fBalways\fR use the \fBrecursive\fR merge strategy for regular merges, and \fBoctopus\fR for octopus merges, with no way to choose a different one\&. To work around this, an \fBexec\fR command can be used to call \fBgit merge\fR explicitly, using the fact that the labels are worktree\-local refs (the ref \fBrefs/rewritten/onto\fR would correspond to the label \fBonto\fR, for example)\&.
.sp
Note: the first command (\fBlabel onto\fR) labels the revision onto which the commits are rebased; The name \fBonto\fR is just a convention, as a nod to the \fB\-\-onto\fR option\&.
.sp
It is also possible to introduce completely new merge commits from scratch by adding a command of the form \fBmerge <merge\-head>\fR\&. This form will generate a tentative commit message and always open an editor to let the user edit it\&. This can be useful e\&.g\&. when a topic branch turns out to address more than a single concern and wants to be split into two or even more topic branches\&. Consider this todo list:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
pick 192837 Switch from GNU Makefiles to CMake
pick 5a6c7e Document the switch to CMake
pick 918273 Fix detection of OpenSSL in CMake
pick afbecd http: add support for TLS v1\&.3
pick fdbaec Fix detection of cURL in CMake on Windows
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
The one commit in this list that is not related to CMake may very well have been motivated by working on fixing all those bugs introduced by switching to CMake, but it addresses a different concern\&. To split this branch into two topic branches, the todo list could be edited like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
