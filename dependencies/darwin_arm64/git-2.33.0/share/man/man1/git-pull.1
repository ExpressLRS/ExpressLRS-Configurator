.SH "NAME"
git-pull \- Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit pull\fR [<options>] [<repository> [<refspec>\&...]]
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current branch\&. In its default mode, \fBgit pull\fR is shorthand for \fBgit fetch\fR followed by \fBgit merge FETCH_HEAD\fR\&.
.sp
More precisely, \fIgit pull\fR runs \fIgit fetch\fR with the given parameters and calls \fIgit merge\fR to merge the retrieved branch heads into the current branch\&. With \fB\-\-rebase\fR, it runs \fIgit rebase\fR instead of \fIgit merge\fR\&.
.sp
<repository> should be the name of a remote repository as passed to \fBgit-fetch\fR(1)\&. <refspec> can name an arbitrary remote ref (for example, the name of a tag) or even a collection of refs with corresponding remote\-tracking branches (e\&.g\&., refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*), but usually it is the name of a branch in the remote repository\&.
.sp
Default values for <repository> and <branch> are read from the "remote" and "merge" configuration for the current branch as set by \fBgit-branch\fR(1) \fB\-\-track\fR\&.
.sp
Assume the following history exists and the current branch is "\fBmaster\fR":
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
          A\-\-\-B\-\-\-C master on origin
         /
    D\-\-\-E\-\-\-F\-\-\-G master
        ^
        origin/master in your repository
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Then "\fBgit pull\fR" will fetch and replay the changes from the remote \fBmaster\fR branch since it diverged from the local \fBmaster\fR (i\&.e\&., \fBE\fR) until its current commit (\fBC\fR) on top of \fBmaster\fR and record the result in a new commit along with the names of the two parent commits and a log message from the user describing the changes\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
          A\-\-\-B\-\-\-C origin/master
         /         \e
    D\-\-\-E\-\-\-F\-\-\-G\-\-\-H master
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
See \fBgit-merge\fR(1) for details, including how conflicts are presented and handled\&.
.sp
In Git 1\&.7\&.0 or later, to cancel a conflicting merge, use \fBgit reset \-\-merge\fR\&. \fBWarning\fR: In older versions of Git, running \fIgit pull\fR with uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it leaves you in a state that may be hard to back out of in the case of a conflict\&.
.sp
If any of the remote changes overlap with local uncommitted changes, the merge will be automatically canceled and the work tree untouched\&. It is generally best to get any local changes in working order before pulling or stash them away with \fBgit-stash\fR(1)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-q, \-\-quiet
.RS 4
This is passed to both underlying git\-fetch to squelch reporting of during transfer, and underlying git\-merge to squelch output during merging\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v, \-\-verbose
.RS 4
Pass \-\-verbose to git\-fetch and git\-merge\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-[no\-]recurse\-submodules[=yes|on\-demand|no]
.RS 4
This option controls if new commits of populated submodules should be fetched, and if the working trees of active submodules should be updated, too (see
\fBgit-fetch\fR(1),
\fBgit-config\fR(1)
and
\fBgitmodules\fR(5))\&.
.sp
If the checkout is done via rebase, local submodule commits are rebased as well\&.
.sp
If the update is done via merge, the submodule conflicts are resolved and checked out\&.
.RE
.SS "Options related to merging"
.PP
\-\-commit, \-\-no\-commit
.RS 4
Perform the merge and commit the result\&. This option can be used to override \-\-no\-commit\&.
.sp
With \-\-no\-commit perform the merge and stop just before creating a merge commit, to give the user a chance to inspect and further tweak the merge result before committing\&.
.sp
Note that fast\-forward updates do not create a merge commit and therefore there is no way to stop those merges with \-\-no\-commit\&. Thus, if you want to ensure your branch is not changed or updated by the merge command, use \-\-no\-ff with \-\-no\-commit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-edit, \-e, \-\-no\-edit
.RS 4
Invoke an editor before committing successful mechanical merge to further edit the auto\-generated merge message, so that the user can explain and justify the merge\&. The
\fB\-\-no\-edit\fR
option can be used to accept the auto\-generated message (this is generally discouraged)\&.
.sp
Older scripts may depend on the historical behaviour of not allowing the user to edit the merge log message\&. They will see an editor opened when they run
\fBgit merge\fR\&. To make it easier to adjust such scripts to the updated behaviour, the environment variable
\fBGIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT\fR
can be set to
\fBno\fR
at the beginning of them\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cleanup=<mode>
.RS 4
This option determines how the merge message will be cleaned up before committing\&. See
\fBgit-commit\fR(1)
for more details\&. In addition, if the
\fI<mode>\fR
is given a value of
\fBscissors\fR, scissors will be appended to
\fBMERGE_MSG\fR
before being passed on to the commit machinery in the case of a merge conflict\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ff, \-\-no\-ff, \-\-ff\-only
.RS 4
Specifies how a merge is handled when the merged\-in history is already a descendant of the current history\&.
\fB\-\-ff\fR
is the default unless merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag that is not stored in its natural place in the
\fBrefs/tags/\fR
hierarchy, in which case
\fB\-\-no\-ff\fR
is assumed\&.
.sp
With
\fB\-\-ff\fR, when possible resolve the merge as a fast\-forward (only update the branch pointer to match the merged branch; do not create a merge commit)\&. When not possible (when the merged\-in history is not a descendant of the current history), create a merge commit\&.
.sp
With
\fB\-\-no\-ff\fR, create a merge commit in all cases, even when the merge could instead be resolved as a fast\-forward\&.
.sp
With
\fB\-\-ff\-only\fR, resolve the merge as a fast\-forward when possible\&. When not possible, refuse to merge and exit with a non\-zero status\&.
.RE
.PP
\-S[<keyid>], \-\-gpg\-sign[=<keyid>], \-\-no\-gpg\-sign
.RS 4
GPG\-sign the resulting merge commit\&. The
\fBkeyid\fR
argument is optional and defaults to the committer identity; if specified, it must be stuck to the option without a space\&.
\fB\-\-no\-gpg\-sign\fR
is useful to countermand both
\fBcommit\&.gpgSign\fR
configuration variable, and earlier
\fB\-\-gpg\-sign\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-log[=<n>], \-\-no\-log
.RS 4
In addition to branch names, populate the log message with one\-line descriptions from at most <n> actual commits that are being merged\&. See also
\fBgit-fmt-merge-msg\fR(1)\&.
.sp
With \-\-no\-log do not list one\-line descriptions from the actual commits being merged\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-signoff, \-\-no\-signoff
.RS 4
Add a
\fBSigned\-off\-by\fR
trailer by the committer at the end of the commit log message\&. The meaning of a signoff depends on the project to which you\(cqre committing\&. For example, it may certify that the committer has the rights to submit the work under the project\(cqs license or agrees to some contributor representation, such as a Developer Certificate of Origin\&. (See
\m[blue]\fBhttp://developercertificate\&.org\fR\m[]
for the one used by the Linux kernel and Git projects\&.) Consult the documentation or leadership of the project to which you\(cqre contributing to understand how the signoffs are used in that project\&.
.sp
The \-\-no\-signoff option can be used to countermand an earlier \-\-signoff option on the command line\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-stat, \-n, \-\-no\-stat
.RS 4
Show a diffstat at the end of the merge\&. The diffstat is also controlled by the configuration option merge\&.stat\&.
.sp
With \-n or \-\-no\-stat do not show a diffstat at the end of the merge\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-squash, \-\-no\-squash
.RS 4
Produce the working tree and index state as if a real merge happened (except for the merge information), but do not actually make a commit, move the
\fBHEAD\fR, or record
\fB$GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD\fR
(to cause the next
\fBgit commit\fR
command to create a merge commit)\&. This allows you to create a single commit on top of the current branch whose effect is the same as merging another branch (or more in case of an octopus)\&.
.sp
With \-\-no\-squash perform the merge and commit the result\&. This option can be used to override \-\-squash\&.
.sp
With \-\-squash, \-\-commit is not allowed, and will fail\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-verify
.RS 4
This option bypasses the pre\-merge and commit\-msg hooks\&. See also
\fBgithooks\fR(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s <strategy>, \-\-strategy=<strategy>
.RS 4
Use the given merge strategy; can be supplied more than once to specify them in the order they should be tried\&. If there is no
\fB\-s\fR
option, a built\-in list of strategies is used instead (\fIgit merge\-recursive\fR
when merging a single head,
\fIgit merge\-octopus\fR
otherwise)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-X <option>, \-\-strategy\-option=<option>
.RS 4
Pass merge strategy specific option through to the merge strategy\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-verify\-signatures, \-\-no\-verify\-signatures
.RS 4
Verify that the tip commit of the side branch being merged is signed with a valid key, i\&.e\&. a key that has a valid uid: in the default trust model, this means the signing key has been signed by a trusted key\&. If the tip commit of the side branch is not signed with a valid key, the merge is aborted\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-summary, \-\-no\-summary
.RS 4
Synonyms to \-\-stat and \-\-no\-stat; these are deprecated and will be removed in the future\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-autostash, \-\-no\-autostash
.RS 4
Automatically create a temporary stash entry before the operation begins, record it in the special ref
\fBMERGE_AUTOSTASH\fR
and apply it after the operation ends\&. This means that you can run the operation on a dirty worktree\&. However, use with care: the final stash application after a successful merge might result in non\-trivial conflicts\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-allow\-unrelated\-histories
.RS 4
By default,
\fBgit merge\fR
command refuses to merge histories that do not share a common ancestor\&. This option can be used to override this safety when merging histories of two projects that started their lives independently\&. As that is a very rare occasion, no configuration variable to enable this by default exists and will not be added\&.
.RE
.PP
\-r, \-\-rebase[=false|true|merges|preserve|interactive]
.RS 4
When true, rebase the current branch on top of the upstream branch after fetching\&. If there is a remote\-tracking branch corresponding to the upstream branch and the upstream branch was rebased since last fetched, the rebase uses that information to avoid rebasing non\-local changes\&.
.sp
When set to
\fBmerges\fR, rebase using
\fBgit rebase \-\-rebase\-merges\fR
so that the local merge commits are included in the rebase (see
\fBgit-rebase\fR(1)
for details)\&.
.sp
When set to
\fBpreserve\fR
(deprecated in favor of
\fBmerges\fR), rebase with the
\fB\-\-preserve\-merges\fR
option passed to
\fBgit rebase\fR
so that locally created merge commits will not be flattened\&.
.sp
When false, merge the upstream branch into the current branch\&.
.sp
When
\fBinteractive\fR, enable the interactive mode of rebase\&.
.sp
See
\fBpull\&.rebase\fR,
\fBbranch\&.<name>\&.rebase\fR
and
\fBbranch\&.autoSetupRebase\fR
in
\fBgit-config\fR(1)
if you want to make
\fBgit pull\fR
always use
\fB\-\-rebase\fR
instead of merging\&.

Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to exclude commits reachable from a specified remote branch or tag\&. This option can be specified multiple times\&.

.RS 4
If the source repository is complete, convert a shallow repository to a complete one, removing all the limitations imposed by shallow repositories\&.

If the source repository is shallow, fetch as much as possible so that the current repository has the same history as the source repository\&.
.RE

.RE
.PP
\-\-negotiation\-tip=<commit|glob>
.RS 4
By default, Git will report, to the server, commits reachable from all local refs to find common commits in an attempt to reduce the size of the to\-be\-received packfile\&. If specified, Git will only report commits reachable from the given tips\&. This is useful to speed up fetches when the user knows which local ref is likely to have commits in common with the upstream ref being fetched\&.
.sp
This option may be specified more than once; if so, Git will report commits reachable from any of the given commits\&.
.sp
The argument to this option may be a glob on ref names, a ref, or the (possibly abbreviated) SHA\-1 of a commit\&. Specifying a glob is equivalent to specifying this option multiple times, one for each matching ref name\&.
.sp
See also the
\fBfetch\&.negotiationAlgorithm\fR

.RS 4
Do not fetch anything from the server, and instead print the ancestors of the provided

.RE
.PP
\-p, \-\-prune
.RS 4
Before fetching, remove any remote\-tracking references that no longer exist on the remote\&. Tags are not subject to pruning if they are fetched only because of the default tag auto\-following or due to a \-\-tags option\&. However, if tags are fetched due to an explicit refspec (either on the command line or in the remote configuration, for example if the remote was cloned with the \-\-mirror option), then they are also subject to pruning\&. Supplying
\fB\-\-prune\-tags\fR
is a shorthand for providing the tag refspec\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-tags
.RS 4
By default, tags that point at objects that are downloaded from the remote repository are fetched and stored locally\&. This option disables this automatic tag following\&. The default behavior for a remote may be specified with the remote\&.<name>\&.tagOpt setting\&. See
\fBgit-config\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-refmap=<refspec>
.RS 4
When fetching refs listed on the command line, use the specified refspec (can be given more than once) to map the refs to remote\-tracking branches, instead of the values of
\fBremote\&.*\&.fetch\fR
configuration variables for the remote repository\&. Providing an empty
\fB<refspec>\fR
to the
\fB\-\-refmap\fR
option causes Git to ignore the configured refspecs and rely entirely on the refspecs supplied as command\-line arguments\&. See section on "Configured Remote\-tracking Branches" for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\-t, \-\-tags
.RS 4
Fetch all tags from the remote (i\&.e\&., fetch remote tags
\fBrefs/tags/*\fR
into local tags with the same name), in addition to whatever else would otherwise be fetched\&. Using this option alone does not subject tags to pruning, even if \-\-prune is used (though tags may be pruned anyway if they are also the destination of an explicit refspec; see
\fB\-\-prune\fR)\&.

<repository>
.RS 4
The "remote" repository that is the source of a fetch or pull operation\&. This parameter can be either a URL (see the section
GIT URLS
below) or the name of a remote (see the section
REMOTES
below)\&.
.RE
.PP
<refspec>
.RS 4
Specifies which refs to fetch and which local refs to update\&. When no <refspec>s appear on the command line, the refs to fetch are read from
\fBremote\&.<repository>\&.fetch\fR
variables instead (see the section "CONFIGURED REMOTE\-TRACKING BRANCHES" in
\fBgit-fetch\fR(1))\&.
.sp
The format of a <refspec> parameter is an optional plus
\fB+\fR, followed by the source <src>, followed by a colon
\fB:\fR, followed by the destination ref <dst>\&. The colon can be omitted when <dst> is empty\&. <src> is typically a ref, but it can also be a fully spelled hex object name\&.
.sp
A <refspec> may contain a
\fB*\fR
in its <src> to indicate a simple pattern match\&. Such a refspec functions like a glob that matches any ref with the same prefix\&. A pattern <refspec> must have a
\fB*\fR
in both the <src> and <dst>\&. It will map refs to the destination by replacing the
\fB*\fR
with the contents matched from the source\&.
.sp
If a refspec is prefixed by
\fB^\fR, it will be interpreted as a negative refspec\&. Rather than specifying which refs to fetch or which local refs to update, such a refspec will instead specify refs to exclude\&. A ref will be considered to match if it matches at least one positive refspec, and does not match any negative refspec\&. Negative refspecs can be useful to restrict the scope of a pattern refspec so that it will not include specific refs\&. Negative refspecs can themselves be pattern refspecs\&. However, they may only contain a <src> and do not specify a <dst>\&. Fully spelled out hex object names are also not supported\&.
.sp
\fBtag <tag>\fR
means the same as
\fBrefs/tags/<tag>:refs/tags/<tag>\fR; it requests fetching everything up to the given tag\&.
.sp
The remote ref that matches <src> is fetched, and if <dst> is not an empty string, an attempt is made to update the local ref that matches it\&.
.sp
Whether that update is allowed without
\fB\-\-force\fR
depends on the ref namespace it\(cqs being fetched to, the type of object being fetched, and whether the update is considered to be a fast\-forward\&. Generally, the same rules apply for fetching as when pushing, see the
\fB<refspec>\&.\&.\&.\fR
section of
\fBgit-push\fR(1)
for what those are\&. Exceptions to those rules particular to
\fIgit fetch\fR
are noted below\&.
.sp
Until Git version 2\&.20, and unlike when pushing with
\fBgit-push\fR(1), any updates to
\fBrefs/tags/*\fR
would be accepted without
\fB+\fR
in the refspec (or
\fB\-\-force\fR)\&. When fetching, we promiscuously considered all tag updates from a remote to be forced fetches\&. Since Git version 2\&.20, fetching to update
\fBrefs/tags/*\fR
works the same way as when pushing\&. I\&.e\&. any updates will be rejected without
\fB+\fR
in the refspec (or
\fB\-\-force\fR)\&.
.sp
Unlike when pushing with
\fBgit-push\fR(1), any updates outside of
\fBrefs/{tags,heads}/*\fR
will be accepted without
\fB+\fR
in the refspec (or
\fB\-\-force\fR), whether that\(cqs swapping e\&.g\&. a tree object for a blob, or a commit for another commit that\(cqs doesn\(cqt have the previous commit as an ancestor etc\&.
.sp
Unlike when pushing with
\fBgit-push\fR(1), there is no configuration which\(cqll amend these rules, and nothing like a
\fBpre\-fetch\fR
hook analogous to the
\fBpre\-receive\fR
hook\&.
.sp
As with pushing with
\fBgit-push\fR(1), all of the rules described above about what\(cqs not allowed as an update can be overridden by adding an the optional leading
\fB+\fR
to a refspec (or using
\fB\-\-force\fR
command line option)\&. The only exception to this is that no amount of forcing will make the
\fBrefs/heads/*\fR
namespace accept a non\-commit object\&.

When the remote branch you want to fetch is known to be rewound and rebased regularly, it is expected that its new tip will not be descendant of its previous tip (as stored in your remote\-tracking branch the last time you fetched)\&. You would want to use the
\fB+\fR
sign to indicate non\-fast\-forward updates will be needed for such branches\&. There is no way to determine or declare that a branch will be made available in a repository with this behavior; the pulling user simply must know this is the expected usage pattern for a branch\&.

There is a difference between listing multiple <refspec> directly on
\fIgit pull\fR
command line and having multiple
\fBremote\&.<repository>\&.fetch\fR
entries in your configuration for a <repository> and running a
\fIgit pull\fR
command without any explicit <refspec> parameters\&. <refspec>s listed explicitly on the command line are always merged into the current branch after fetching\&. In other words, if you list more than one remote ref,
\fIgit pull\fR
will create an Octopus merge\&. On the other hand, if you do not list any explicit <refspec> parameter on the command line,
\fIgit pull\fR
will fetch all the <refspec>s it finds in the
\fBremote\&.<repository>\&.fetch\fR
configuration and merge only the first <refspec> found into the current branch\&. This is because making an Octopus from remote refs is rarely done, while keeping track of multiple remote heads in one\-go by fetching more than one is often useful\&.

In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol, the address of the remote server, and the path to the repository\&. Depending on the transport protocol, some of this information may be absent\&.

Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp, and ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient and deprecated; do not use it)\&.

If there are a large number of similarly\-named remote repositories and you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you use will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a configuration section of the form:

a URL like "work:repo\&.git" or like "host\&.xz:/path/to/repo\&.git" will be rewritten in any context that takes a URL to be "git://git\&.host\&.xz/repo\&.git"\&.

With the strategies that use 3\-way merge (including the default, \fIrecursive\fR), if a change is made on both branches, but later reverted on one of the branches, that change will be present in the merged result; some people find this behavior confusing\&.

.SH "DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR"

Often people use \fBgit pull\fR without giving any parameter\&. Traditionally, this has been equivalent to saying \fBgit pull origin\fR\&. However, when configuration \fBbranch\&.<name>\&.remote\fR is present while on branch \fB<name>\fR, that value is used instead of \fBorigin\fR\&.
.sp
In order to determine what URL to use to fetch from, the value of the configuration \fBremote\&.<origin>\&.url\fR is consulted and if there is not any such variable, the value on the \fBURL:\fR line in \fB$GIT_DIR/remotes/<origin>\fR is used\&.
.sp
In order to determine what remote branches to fetch (and optionally store in the remote\-tracking branches) when the command is run without any refspec parameters on the command line, values of the configuration variable \fBremote\&.<origin>\&.fetch\fR are consulted, and if there aren\(cqt any, \fB$GIT_DIR/remotes/<origin>\fR is consulted and its \fBPull:\fR lines are used\&. In addition to the refspec formats described in the OPTIONS section, you can have a globbing refspec that looks like this:

Now the victim believes that the attacker has X, and it sends the content of X back to the attacker later\&. (This attack is most straightforward for a client to perform on a server, by creating a ref to X in the namespace the client has access to and then fetching it\&. The most likely way for a server to perform it on a client is to "merge" X into a public branch and hope that the user does additional work on this branch and pushes it back to the server without noticing the merge\&.)
