<hr />

<p><a href="https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager">Git Credential Manager</a> (GCM) is a secure
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials">Git credential helper</a> built on <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com">.NET</a> that runs
on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It aims to provide a consistent and secure
authentication experience, including multi-factor auth, to every major source
control hosting service and platform.</p>

<p>GCM supports (in alphabetical order) <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops">Azure DevOps</a>, Azure DevOps
Server (formerly Team Foundation Server), Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab.
Compare to Git's <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage">built-in credential helpers</a>
(Windows: wincred, macOS: osxkeychain, Linux: gnome-keyring/libsecret), which
provide single-factor authentication support for username/password only.</p>

<p>GCM replaces both the .NET Framework-based
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows">Git Credential Manager for Windows</a> and the Java-based
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Mac-and-Linux">Git Credential Manager for Mac and Linux</a>.</p>

<h2>Install</h2>

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager/blob/release/docs/install.md">installation instructions</a> for the current version of GCM for
install options for your operating system.</p>

<h2>Current status</h2>

<p>Git Credential Manager is currently available for Windows, macOS, and Linux*.
GCM only works with HTTP(S) remotes; you can still use Git with SSH:</p>

supported by dotnet</a>.</p>

<h2>Supported Git versions</h2>

<p>Git Credential Manager tries to be compatible with the broadest set of Git
versions (within reason). However there are some know problematic releases of
Git that are not compatible.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Git 1.x</p>

<p>The initial major version of Git is not supported or tested with GCM.</p></li>
<li><p>Git 2.26.2</p>

<p>This version of Git introduced a breaking change with parsing credential
configuration that GCM relies on. This issue was fixed in commit
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/12294990c90e043862be9eb7eb22c3784b526340"><code>12294990</code></a> of the Git project, and released in Git
2.27.0.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>How to use</h2>

<p>Once it's installed and configured, Git Credential Manager is called implicitly
by Git. You don't have to do anything special, and GCM isn't intended to be
called directly by the user. For example, when pushing (<code>git push</code>) to
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops">Azure DevOps</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a>, or <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, a
window will automatically open and walk you through the sign-in process. (This
process will look slightly different for each Git host, and even in some cases,
whether you've connected to an on-premises or cloud-hosted Git host.) Later Git
commands in the same repository will re-use existing credentials or tokens that
GCM has stored for as long as they're valid.</p>
